# gallerychat

__gallerychat__ is a chat mockup: every chatmember has its own tile.

I am not totally convinced of videocalls. In my opinion it is enough to use the audio channel as the main means of communication and a chat channel as a second option.

Of course there are many benefits from using videos like [nod vigorously or do thumbs-up, gesture like raise hands](https://martinfowler.com/articles/effective-video-calls.html)


but I think those can also be found in a chat. Maybe to a certain degree not as much in the good old serial chat. Therefore I`d like to establish a chat within [gallery view](https://martinfowler.com/articles/effective-video-calls.html), like they already exist in video calls, so all participants are able to __see everyone at the same time__.

## additional Features

* send images
* switch from text to camera 
* the order - who said what when. Maybe express it with a color gradient, so that it is at least clear where there is something new at a glance.
