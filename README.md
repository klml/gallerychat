# gallerychat

__gallerychat__ is a chat mockup: every chatmember has its own tile.

Martin Fowler on [effective video calls](https://martinfowler.com/articles/effective-video-calls.html):

* __Turn on the video__ 
* __Use gallery mode__ _where every participant is visible in their own window._
* __Use the chat__ is _a useful second channel_.
* __Use gestures__ _like to nod vigorously or do thumbs-up_ or _raise my hand_.
* But __drop video if bandwidth is an issue__

So this tool is to _drop video_ but still _use text gestures_ in a chat _gallery mode_ to see __all participants equally__.
